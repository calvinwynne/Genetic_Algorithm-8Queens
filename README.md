# Genetic_Algorithm-8Queens
Solving the 8 Queens Challenge using Genetic Algorithm. The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. This project demonstrates the implementation of Genetic algorithm and its advantages over backtracking.

The program allows the user to return a solution generated using the Genetic Algortihm
The Program can display a graphical board that updates with evey move if needed.

Options: 

show_board --> shows the board animate as coins are positioned

Show_score --> Shows the score for each gene [20 ----- > 0]
